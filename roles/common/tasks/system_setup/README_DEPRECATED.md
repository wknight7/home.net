# DEPRECATED: System setup tasks have been migrated to specialized repositories
# 
# - Clock/timezone: Available in lxc repository with Alpine Linux support
# - Locale: Available in lxc repository  
# - Python/pip: Available in lxc repository
# - OpenSSH: Available in lxc repository
# - Cron: Available in lxc repository
# - Logging: Available in lxc repository
#
# This system_setup directory is kept for backward compatibility but should
# not be used for new deployments. Use the specialized repositories instead:
# - /home/bill/git/lxc for container systems
# - /home/bill/git/workstations for desktop systems
#
# These files will be removed in a future cleanup once all playbooks have
# been migrated to use the specialized repositories.
